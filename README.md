# JSON to CAD

This program is meant to convert BackToCAD.json files generated by [SkyReal VR][skyreal-vr] to a neutral 3D CAD format. It is neither created nor endorsed by SkyReal.

## Requirements

### Development

- Java Development Kit, version 17 or later
- [JavaFX 21 SDK](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)
- [JSDAI 4.5](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsdai/files/v4.5.0/)

## Building (WIP)

JSDAI isn't in Maven central, so it needs to be installed locally.

- Install the following files from the extracted JSDAI release by following the instructions in `doc/local-maven-dependencies.txt` "Install with install:install-file":
  - `jsdai/jsdai_runtime.jar`
- Install the `jsdai_parent` `pom.xml` by [downloading it from SourceForge][jsdai_parent-pom] and following the instructions in `doc/local-maven-dependencies.txt` "Installing only a POM file".

After that, you should be able to run `mvn install` from the commandline or using your IDE. See [Getting Started with JavaFX][openjfx-docs] if you have any issues.
